There is some limit to what we can do here.
This is not really markdown.
• Here's a list item.
• Here's one with _italics_.
• Here's one with *bold*.

```
Literal works but not with a specified format
{
  "Here": "is-some",
  "json": true
}
```

Embedded `literal` also works. Do Links like <https://qbilt.org|this>.
